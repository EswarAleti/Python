Use Python

From the previous project you know how to generate a random 8-letter DNA fragment. Now you will generate its complement. However, we will do this for a 4-letter fragment, You can do this easily (conceptually anyway) because you know that :

A pairs with T; C pairs with G; T pairs with A and C pairs with C as shown in the picture below.

For this project do the following:

In the same program

    Generate a random 4-letter DNA fragment. We will call it the original.
    Print the letters of the fragment
    Keep randomly generating fragments until one is generated that is the complement of the original
    Count how many times a random fragment was generated until the random generation of fragments resulted in generating the complement of the original fragment.
    Print the letters of this complement
    Print the number of times it took to generate random fragments before the right one, i.e. the complement to the first randomly generated fragment was generated.

Make sure the outputs (what is printed) are clearly identified as follows:

    Original
    Complement
    Count
